## Introduction

WebDAV, short for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, is a protocol that allows users to manage files on remote servers. It's a powerful tool for data storage and synchronization, making it an excellent choice for Zhang Accounting users who require remote access to their accounting data. This guide will walk you through the steps to configure WebDAV as a data source for Zhang Accounting.

## Configuration Requirements

To integrate WebDAV with Zhang Accounting, you'll need to provide specific configuration details. Here's what you need:

| Parameter | Command Line Argument | Environment Variable | Required | Example Value | Remarks |
|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------|----------|---------------|---------|
| Data Source | source | ZHANG_DATA_SOURCE | Yes | `web-dav` | Identifies WebDAV as the data source. |
| WebDAV Server Address | N/A | ZHANG_WEBDAV_ENDPOINT | Yes | `https://dav.example.com/dav` | The URL to your WebDAV server. |
| WebDAV Data Root Directory | N/A | ZHANG_WEBDAV_ROOT | Yes | `/accounting` | The root directory in your WebDAV server where data will be stored. |
| WebDAV Username | N/A | ZHANG_WEBDAV_USERNAME | Yes | `your_username` | Your WebDAV account username. |
| WebDAV Password | N/A | ZHANG_WEBDAV_PASSWORD | No | `your_password` | Your WebDAV account password. |

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Identify Your WebDAV Server Details**: Gather the URL, root directory, username, and password for your WebDAV server.
2. **Configure Environment Variables**: Set the environment variables listed above with the appropriate values. This can be done in your system settings or directly when running Zhang Accounting.
3. **Launch Zhang Accounting**: With the environment variables set, start Zhang Accounting. The application will automatically connect to the specified WebDAV server and use it as the data source.

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom SSL Certificates

If your WebDAV server uses a custom SSL certificate, you may need to configure Zhang Accounting to trust this certificate. This involves adding the certificate to your system's trusted certificates store or specifying it directly in the Zhang Accounting configuration.

### Proxy Settings

If you're behind a proxy, configure the proxy settings in your environment to ensure Zhang Accounting can reach your WebDAV server. This typically involves setting the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Verify that the WebDAV server URL is correct and accessible from your network. Check firewall and proxy settings if necessary.
- **Authentication Failures**: Double-check your username and password. Ensure that your WebDAV server is configured to accept connections from Zhang Accounting.
- **Data Synchronization Errors**: Ensure that the specified root directory exists on your WebDAV server and that it has the correct permissions.

## Conclusion

Setting up WebDAV as a data source for Zhang Accounting enables seamless remote access to your accounting data. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily integrate WebDAV into your accounting workflow, ensuring that your data is always accessible, no matter where you are.
